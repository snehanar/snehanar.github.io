Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Technology and Social Behavior program at Northwestern University. My research is focused on newcomer mobilization and socialization in decentralized volunteer communities such as Wikipedia, and fan wikis.

I am advised by Aaron Shaw, and am a member of the Community Data Science Collective.

Prior to arriving at Northwestern, I received an MA in Sociology and Social Anthropology from Central European University, and a BA in Mathematics from Oberlin College.
