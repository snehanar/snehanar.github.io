Iâ€™m faculty in the [Computer Science](https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cs/) department at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/). Before my current appointment, I worked on a PhD in the [Technology and Social Behavior](http://tsb.northwestern.edu/) program at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/). My research is focused on understanding how technical systems foster participation and collaboration in decentralized volunteer communities such as Wikipedia, and fan wikis. I am also a member of the [Community Data Science Collective](https://communitydata.cc/), a research group that includes my PhD advisor [Aaron Shaw](http://aaronshaw.org/), committee member [Benjamin Mako Hill](https://mako.cc/) and several other friends and collaborators. 

Prior to beginning my doctoral work, I received an MA in [Sociology and Social Anthropology](https://sociology.ceu.edu/) from [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/), and a BA in [Mathematics](http://new.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/mathematics/) from [Oberlin College](http://www.oberlin.edu).
